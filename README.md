# Tanks

Welcome to the repository for **Tanks**, a meticulously crafted game that innovatively recreates "Tanks!" from Wii's "Wii Play". This project is a testament to modern game development, blending nostalgia with cutting-edge technology.

## Game Description

**Tanks** is not just a homage to the classic "Tanks!" game; it transcends conventional gaming boundaries. It offers players an immersive and strategic adventure, thanks to advanced pathfinding techniques and a variety of tank personalities that enrich the gameplay.

### Development

This project demonstrates both my technical proficiency and my commitment to delivering unique and creative programs. The game is developed using:
- **Language**: C#
- **Frameworks**: MonoGame, Pipeline

### Key Challenges Surmounted:

- **Customized Pathfinding Algorithm:** Tailoring the pathfinding logic to reflect the unique personality of each tank was a significant endeavor. Achieving this required a deep dive into algorithmic customization to ensure each tank's movement felt distinct and intelligent.
- **Precise Auto-Aiming Mechanism for Enemy Tanks:** Contrary to initial expectations, developing a mathematically robust auto-aiming system for enemy tanks presented numerous complexities. The solution demanded intricate mathematical models to achieve precision and realism.
- **Advanced Collision Detection:** Implementing comprehensive collision detection was paramount. This involved ensuring bullets, walls, tanks, water, and other elements interacted with each other realistically, necessitating meticulous physics and geometry calculations.
- **Efficient Game State Preservation:** Capturing and storing user game states for seamless continuity across sessions was a multifaceted challenge. This required not only tracking stars, game statistics, and unlocked levels but also designing a storage solution that was both efficient and reliable, ensuring a seamless user experience upon each login.

### Repository Contents
