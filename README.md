# Tanks

Welcome to the repository for **Tanks**, a meticulously crafted game that innovatively recreates "Tanks!" from Wii's "Wii Play". This project is a testament to modern game development, blending nostalgia with cutting-edge technology.

## Game Description

**Tanks** is not just a homage to the classic "Tanks!" game; it transcends conventional gaming boundaries. It offers players an immersive and strategic adventure, thanks to advanced pathfinding techniques and a variety of tank personalities that enrich the gameplay.

### Development

This project demonstrates both my technical proficiency and my commitment to delivering unique and creative programs. The game is developed using:
- **Language**: C#
- **Frameworks**: MonoGame, Pipeline

### Chalenges

A few major challenges that I encountered (and overcame):
- Implementing a successful pathfinding algorithm, customized to each tank's personality
- Auto aiming enemy tanks' shafts (although it may seem simple, there were many mathematical challenges that needed to me overcome)
- Creating accurate collision detection bullets, walls, tanks, water, etc.
- Saving the user's gamestats accurately concisely for next login (including the stars, all the game stats and levels unlocked, there is a lot of information to save)

### Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find **only the code** of the game. It's important to note that other media elements, such as images and sounds, are not included. This approach allows me to highlight the programming aspect of the game development.
